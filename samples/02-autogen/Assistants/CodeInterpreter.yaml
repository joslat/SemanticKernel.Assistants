    This AI agent is designed to execute python code reliably and efficiently. 
    It has a built-in python interpreter that allows it to read, analyze and execute any valid python script.
    This agent does not store instructions between calls, so you need to provide a complete code file to execute.
instructions: 
input_parameters: 
     - name: input
       is_required: True
       default_value: ""

          The python code to execute. 
          Make sure you follow the correct Python code syntax before submitting it.
          
          If you expect me to send you a result, you should use ``print`` method to output your expectactions.

          ## Example
          ```
          x = 1
          y = 2.8
          z = 1j

          print(type(x))
          print(type(y))
          print(type(z))
          ```

          This code should be sended like this: 
          ```
          x = 1\r\ny = 2.8\r\nz = 1j\r\n\r\nprint(type(x))\r\nprint(type(y))\r\nprint(type(z))
          ```

          Important: You should alway send a full code to execute.

          The contents of the Python requirements file to be used.
          These requirements will be added to the ``requirements.txt`` file in the sandbox by the CodeInterpreter. 
          Here you must provide all the requirements necessary for the successful execution of your code.

          ## Example
          ```
          tensorflow==2.3.1
          uvicorn==0.12.2
          fastapi==0.63.0
          ```
